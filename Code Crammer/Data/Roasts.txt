Let's see what fresh mess we're documenting today.
Time to put lipstick on this pig.
Is it 'refactoring' or 'admitting defeat'?
I've seen better code on a microwave.
Just ship it. What's the worst that could happen?
It's not a bug, it's an undocumented feature.
Powered by caffeine and questionable life choices.
Let's turn this spaghetti into... slightly more organized spaghetti.
Counting tokens because my tears are too hard to quantify.
Preparing a summary of your mistakes. You're welcome.
Works on my machine. The official seal of 'not my problem'.
This code is self-documenting. Unfortunately, it speaks only in riddles.
Another day of convincing rocks to think for a living.
Legacy Code Mode: Activated. Abandon all hope.
I'm not saying I'm a bad programmer, but my rubber duck just quit.
This code has more patches than a pirate's wardrobe.
Project Scraper: Because 'git blame' isn't personal enough.
Let's be honest, you're just using this to see how much trouble you're in.
TODO: Re-evaluate all life choices that led to this moment.
The code is clean, but the conscience isn't.
Agile development: Making it up as we go along, but in two-week sprints.
My code is like a toddler's drawing. I'm proud of it, but I have no idea what it does.
The best part of my job is that the coffee is free. That's also the worst part.
Is it 'imposter syndrome' if you're actually an imposter?
Documenting the crime scene.
There are two types of code: the kind you complain about, and the kind nobody uses.
I don't need a debugger. I just stare at the code until I confess my sins.
Today's goal: Write code that even future-me can't break.
It compiled. Let's not ask too many questions.
I'm a software developer. I solve problems you didn't know you had in ways you don't understand.
This project has a bright future. Just not with this codebase.
Scrape results are in: it's worse than we thought.
