\# Code Crammer 🦁



A ruthless Windows Forms utility that processes, sanitizes, and compresses entire .NET solutions into a single, AI-ready text file.



Code Crammer allows you to feed massive codebases into Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT or Claude by stripping away the noise and focusing on the logic.



\## 🔥 Features



\*   \*\*Universal Scraping\*\*: recursively processes C# (`.cs`), VB.NET (`.vb`), JSON, XML, and Config files.

\*   \*\*Bible Mode (Distill Project)\*\*: extracts only class signatures and method headers, ignoring the body. Perfect for giving AI a "map" of your project without eating tokens.

\*   \*\*Designer Squishing\*\*: compresses 2,000+ lines of Windows Forms Designer code into a single-line summary of controls and properties.

\*   \*\*Token Counting\*\*: multi-threaded, real-time token estimation based on GPT-4 logic.

\*   \*\*Sanitization\*\*: strips comments, binary RESX data, and whitespace to maximize information density.

\*   \*\*Spell-Checker\*\*: integrated Hunspell engine to check your custom prompt messages before generating.

\*   \*\*Profile System\*\*: save and load different scraping configurations for different projects.
